      <h2>Importance of Workers in Daily Life</h2>
      <div class="qa">
        <p class="qa-question"><span class="icon">üõ†Ô∏è</span> Why are workers essential?</p>
        <p class="qa-answer">
          Workers like plumbers, electricians, cleaners, and carpenters are the backbone of our daily lives. They ensure our homes function smoothly by fixing leaks, repairing electrical faults, maintaining cleanliness, and building or repairing essential structures. Without their expertise, small issues could escalate into major inconveniences, disrupting our routines and safety.

      </div>
      <div class="qa">
        <p class="qa-question"><span class="icon">üè°</span> How do they impact our lives?</p>
        <p class="qa-answer">
          Imagine a day without a plumber to fix a burst pipe, an electrician to restore power during an outage, or a cleaner to maintain hygiene in your space. These workers save time, reduce stress, and ensure our living environments are safe and comfortable. They also contribute to the economy by providing essential services and creating job opportunities.
